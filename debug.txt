Problems with code

category comment delete contains only white space 

it does not go into the text drill down

I think that the check for whitespace needs to be up front when we check for comments
 in the Java and ast drill downs
 
 the java drill down populates ast with null if it has no assigned ast. this could be an indication of whitespace comment or other text.
 could also be the command for the parent which we need to get rid of.
 

 
 There is only whitespace modifications rather than white-space deletes 
 
 
null
null

new TypeAnalysis().apply(cf);
new ClassFileVerifier().apply(cf);


Memory issue

java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded

It still exhibits even if the AstDrillDown is ommited
It still exhibits even if the CodeBlock drill down is ommited
It does not exhit if the compilation unit is not loaded

Conclusion
not a git issue even though is sometimes prints out a git stack trace
it has something to do with the loading of the entire compilation unit

It progressively gets worse with each entry added

removing 
oldAst = oldEnt.getCompilationUnit(oldCb.getRevision(), oldPath);
without anything else exhibits this behaviour

its in the jastaddJ java parser
making only one javaer parser does not fix the issue
